Neverending-Story
=================

Welcome to Neverending Story!
Nevereding Story is a collaboritive story-writing game where the players work together to create a story based on a given prompt

1. Each story is composed of multiple rounds

2. Each round has two parts. In the first part, you and your co-authors write your addition to the narrative in-progress. 
Keep an eye on the old-timey timer on the upper right hand side of the screen.
when the second-hand reaches 12 o clock, you are out of time!

3. The second stage of the round is the voting stage. 
Tab through all of your co-authors submissions and vote on the one you think is the best addition to the unfolding narrative.

4. After everyone votes, the submission with the most votes will be incorporated into the story!

5. Now a new round starts, with everyone writing a new submission based on the continuation of the previous round's winning submisison.

6. When a game first begins, you may see a prompt at the top of the page. 
You are meant to continue the story based on this prompt. 
So, for example, if you see "It was a dark and stormy night..." you could write "and the rain fell in torrents..." for your submission. 
If you don't see a prompt, write anything at all to start the story off!
